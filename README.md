## Notes
- Make sure that the profile is a public profile.
- Currently this tool is not able to download private profiles that you are following.
- Downloading too much in a short period of time may cause in error, becaue Instagram has a limit of how much you could download. It may block your id address, if happens so, wait a day or two it will get fixed autimatically.
